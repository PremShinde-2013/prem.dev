## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

I enjoy crafting **full-stack** projects in my spare moments and delving into new technologies.

### TypeScript

First of all, the programming language. I'm very used to using **TypeScript**, although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc.

The JavaScript superset—TypeScript—has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2023} years**.

### React

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2022 ({2024 - 2022} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been using SCSS for a longer time ({2024 - 2022} years).

**I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

### Redux

Managing state in complex applications can be challenging, but Redux has been a game-changer for me. I've been integrating **Redux** into my projects to ensure predictable state management.

### Three.js

Three.js has opened up a new dimension of web development for me. Creating **3D graphics** and animations on the web is both exciting and rewarding.

### Framer Motion

For animations, I am more comfortable using Framer Motion. Creating animations using JavaScript has **never been as easy as using Framer Motion**.

### Next.js

I've been using CRA for a few years, but since discovering Next.js, I don't think I would want to use any other web framework. **It's just that good!**

### Stripe

Handling payments can be complex, but **Stripe** has made it straightforward for me to integrate secure and efficient payment processing into my web applications.

## Back-End Developer

### Node.js

Node.js has enabled me to write server-side code using JavaScript, allowing for a unified development experience. I've been working with Node.js to build scalable and efficient backend services.

### MongoDB

For managing databases, MongoDB has been my go-to solution. Its flexibility and scalability have proven invaluable in many of my projects.

### Express.js

Express.js simplifies building web applications with Node.js. Its minimalist and flexible approach makes it my preferred framework for backend development.

### Firebase

Firebase provides a suite of tools for building and managing applications. From real-time databases to authentication, Firebase has been a reliable backend solution for me.

### Redis

Redis is my choice for in-memory data storage. It's incredibly fast and perfect for caching and real-time analytics.

### MySQL

For relational databases, MySQL has been my trusted solution. It’s robust, reliable, and has been a part of my backend technology stack for many years.

### Prisma

Prisma is a modern ORM that simplifies database interactions. It has enhanced my productivity by providing type-safe database queries.

### GraphQL

GraphQL has revolutionized how I handle data fetching in my applications. Its flexibility and efficiency have made it a key part of my stack.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
