Entering the world of web development **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2022} years ago** was like stepping into a realm of boundless creativity. Mastering the MERN stack, I navigated between front-end finesse and back-end prowess, crafting seamless digital experiences.

In the realm of UI/UX design, every pixel became a brushstroke in the canvas of innovation. Now, I'm venturing into Next.js, unlocking new possibilities for modern web apps.

With each project, I embark on a journey of discovery, pushing boundaries and fueling my passion for digital excellence.

## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### TypeScript

<FrontendSkill />

First of all, the programming language. I'm very used to using **TypeScript**, although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc.

The JavaScript superset—TypeScript—has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2023} years**.

### React

<ReactSkill />

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2022 ({2024 - 2022} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been using SCSS for a longer time ({2020 - 2016} years).

**I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

### Framer Motion

For animations, I am more comfortable using Framer Motion. Creating animations using JavaScript has **never been as easy as using Framer Motion**.

### Next.js

I've been using CRA for a few years, but since discovering Next.js, I don't think I would want to use any other web framework. **It's just that good!**

## UI/UX Designer

Designing user interfaces is something I'm really good at and I've been a UI/UX designer **from 2018 to present ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years)**.

I'm always thinking about how to create the best possible user experience, in addition to creating visually appealing user interfaces.

The biggest challenge is finding the balance between creating a great user interface and an amazing user experience.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
